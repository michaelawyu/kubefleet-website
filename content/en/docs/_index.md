## About KubeFleet

KubeFleet is a CNCF sandbox project that aims to simplify Kubernetes multi-cluster management .
It can greatly enhance your multi-cluster management experience; specifically,
with the help of KubeFleet, one is able to easily:

* manage clusters through one unified portal; and
* place Kubernetes resources across a group of clusters with advanced scheduling capabilities; and
* roll out changes progressively; and
* perform administrative tasks easily, such as observing application status, detecting configuration drifts, migrating workloads across clusters, etc.

## Is KubeFleet right for my multi-cluster setup?

* ✅ KubeFleet can work with any Kubernetes clusters running supported Kubernetes versions, regardless of where they are set up.

    You can set up KubeFleet with an on-premises cluster, a cluster hosted on public clouds such as
    Azure, or even a local kind cluster.

* ✅ KubeFleet can manage Kubernetes cluster groups of various sizes. 

    KubeFleet is designed with performance and scalablity in mind. It functions well with both
    smaller Kubernetes cluster groups and those with up to hundreds of Kubernetes clusters and
    thousands of nodes.

* 🚀 KubeFleet is evolving fast.

    We are actively developing new features and functionalities for KubeFleet. If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedbacks, please [let us know](https://github.com/kubefleet-dev/kubefleet/issues).

## Get started

Find out how to deploy KubeFleet with one of our [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) tutorials. You can use a local setup to experiment with KubeFleet's features, and explore its UX.
