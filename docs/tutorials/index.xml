&lt;h2 id="scenario">Scenario&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Your fleet consists of the following clusters:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Member Cluster 1 &amp;amp; Member Cluster 2 (WestUS, 1 node each)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Member Cluster 3 (EastUS2, 2 nodes)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Member Cluster 4 &amp;amp; Member Cluster 5 (WestEurope, 3 nodes each)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Due to certain circumstances, Member Cluster 1 and Member Cluster 2 are down, requiring you to migrate your applications from these clusters to other operational ones.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Resource Migration With Overrides</title><link>https://kubefleet.dev/docs/tutorials/migrationwithoverridedr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubefleet.dev/docs/tutorials/migrationwithoverridedr/</guid><description>&lt;p>This tutorial shows how to migrate applications from clusters with lower availability to those with higher availability,
while also scaling up the number of replicas, using Fleet.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="scenario">Scenario&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Your fleet consists of the following clusters:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Member Cluster 1 &amp;amp; Member Cluster 2 (WestUS, 1 node each)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Member Cluster 3 (EastUS2, 2 nodes)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Member Cluster 4 &amp;amp; Member Cluster 5 (WestEurope, 3 nodes each)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Due to a sudden increase in traffic and resource demands in your WestUS clusters, you need to migrate your applications to clusters in EastUS2 or WestEurope that have higher availability and can better handle the increased load.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>KubeFleet and ArgoCD Integration</title><link>https://kubefleet.dev/docs/tutorials/argocd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubefleet.dev/docs/tutorials/argocd/</guid><description>&lt;p>This hands-on guide of KubeFleet and ArgoCD integration shows how these powerful tools work in concert to revolutionize multi-cluster application management.
Discover how KubeFleet&amp;rsquo;s intelligent orchestration capabilities complement ArgoCD&amp;rsquo;s popular GitOps approach, enabling seamless deployments across diverse environments while maintaining consistency and control.
This tutorial illuminates practical strategies for targeted deployments, environment-specific configurations, and safe, controlled rollouts.
Follow along to transform your multi-cluster challenges into streamlined, automated workflows that enhance both developer productivity and operational reliability.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
